# Conway's Game of Life

## Rules

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation)
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction)
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation
